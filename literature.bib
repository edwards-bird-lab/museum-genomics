This year brought dismal news about the world's birds: They are vanishing at an alarming rate. Across 25 European countries, about 420 million fewer birds are present today than in 1980, a 20\% decrease, especially in the 36 most common species. In North America, The State of the Birds Report 2014 indicates that over the past 40 years, the numbers of individuals across 33 species are also down by hundreds of millions. Such assessments highlight the urgency of determining the precise causes of these declines. The knowledge gleaned from the Avian Phylogenomics Project, coupled with ecological and population analyses, should provide new insights into the factors that influence bird declines and extinctions. As the project progresses over the next few years, over 60\% of tissue samples for the avian analyses will be derived from archived museum collections. In this era of deteriorating natural environments, a pressing challenge is to continue to build scientific collections for future needs.

Museum collections, and the species they represent, provide windows into the past, inform about the present, and help predict the future of natural habitats and human-altered environments. They are the common language of the biological sciences. An antiquated view of collections suggests drawers of bird skins, empty shells, and dried plants. However, current collections also include living specimens, spirit-preserved samples, deep-frozen tissues, and DNA. These irreplaceable biomaterials are invaluable representatives of Earth's biodiversity, and together with their associated metadata are archived ex situ for long-term documentation, public education and exhibition, and scientific and applied research. Although the exact number of collections maintained in museums, botanic gardens, and universities is unknown, estimates as high as three billion specimens suggest the magnitude of this storehouse of information about the natural world.

Many scientists continue to use collections to discover, describe, and document plants and animals with time-proven methods. At the same time, the application of new and multiple technologies to study specimens is blossoming. For example, much of our current understanding of some recently extinct species, such as the Tasmanian tiger, the Caribbean monk seal, and the passenger pigeon, has directly resulted from genomic information extracted from museum collections. And combining DNA-, amino acid– and isotope-based analyses of a few grams of bone from a historical specimen of an endangered Pacific seabird, the Hawaiian petrel, has illuminated aspects of the bird's diet, past population demographics, food chain dynamics, and the deleterious impacts of industrial fishing on this oceanic predator. Museums are becoming an unparalleled resource of tissue samples for large-scale genomic studies of animals and plants.

Yet contributions to genomic studies are but one use of museum collections. Extinctions due to human impacts are also readily studied through historical records preserved in scientific collections. These records reveal former patterns of geographic distributions and population abundances of species that today are threatened or extinct. Museum collections equally contribute to the discovery of previously unknown species, such as the olinguito, a carnivorous mammal from South America.

Most museum specimens were not collected for the purposes for which they are now used. Innovation in technologies will continue to reveal new information previously unanticipated in scientific specimens. Therefore, the most pressing challenge is to build collections for future needs that maximize access and benefit-sharing for all. Collections must be sustained for the long term, which will require increased funding for their physical and scientific curation. A formidable task that has only just begun is the computerized inventory and digitization of the wealth of information that collections represent. At present, most of these data are not accessible electronically or online.

The worldwide decline of birds is just one part of a large and grim picture; the number of individuals of all wild animals on Earth has decreased by 50\% since the 1970s. This drastic decline underscores the vital inherent value of museum collections today, tomorrow, and into the future.

	abstract = {In their Perspective “Rigorous wildlife disease surveillance” (10 July, p. 145), M. Watsa et al. underscore the value of One Health approaches to stimulate integration across currently siloed efforts in zoonotic research and mitigation. To achieve comprehensive decentralized pathogen surveillance, there is an urgent need to develop environmental and biodiversity infrastructure in biodiverse countries experiencing high rates of habitat conversion, wildlife trafficking, and human-wildlife interactions.

Approximately one-third of One Health networks lack an environmental component, fewer than half are active in wildlife surveillance, and almost none is led by developing countries ([ 1 ][1]). International support for development of natural history museums with frozen vertebrate tissue collections remains a key component missing from the One Health equation. Most pathogens causing severe outbreaks in humans are zoonotic in origin ([ 2 ][2]); thus, understanding their evolution and that of their wild animal hosts is imperative.

As was the case for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) ([ 3 ][3]), identifying wild animal reservoirs can be challenging when biorepositories are lacking ([ 4 ][4]). In most countries, natural history biorepositories remain poorly supported and largely disconnected from public health initiatives. For example, most studies of bat coronaviruses to date ([ 5 ][5]), including the PREDICT animal surveys discussed in Watsa et al. , did not preserve host specimens or tissues, thus limiting the potential for molecular host identification or replication and extension of the science ([ 6 ][6]). Emerging infectious disease response hinges on sampling depth across space, time, and taxonomy, the very sampling enabled by museum biorepositories. As primary biological infrastructure, in-country development of museum collections that follow best practices ([ 7 ][7]), with specimen data freely available through the internet, should be an international imperative ([ 8 ][8]) for effective global surveillance and mitigation of emerging infectious diseases.

These repositories have traditionally been used to address fundamental questions in biogeography, systematics and conservation. However, they also hold the potential for studying evolution directly. While some of the best direct observations of evolution have come from long-term field studies or from experimental studies in the laboratory, natural history collections are providing new insights into evolutionary change in natural populations. By comparing phenotypic and genotypic changes in populations through time, natural history collections provide a window into evolutionary processes. Recent studies utilizing this approach have revealed some dramatic instances of phenotypic change over short timescales in response to presumably strong selective pressures. In some instances, evolutionary change can be paired with environmental change, providing a context for potential selective forces. Moreover, in a few cases, the genetic basis of phenotypic change is well understood, allowing for insight into adaptive change at multiple levels. These kinds of studies open the door to a wide range of previously intractable questions by enabling the study of evolution through time, analogous to experimental studies in the laboratory, but amenable to a diversity of species over longer timescales in natural populations.},

Yet, our knowledge of how anthropogenic drivers affect biodiversity and natural resources is limited by a lack of biological data spanning the Anthropocene. We propose that the hundreds of millions of plant, fungal and animal specimens deposited in natural history museums have the potential to transform the field of global change biology. We suggest that museum specimens are underused, particularly in ecological studies, given their capacity to reveal patterns that are not observable from other data sources. Increasingly, museum specimens are becoming mobilized online, providing unparalleled access to physiological, ecological and evolutionary data spanning decades and sometimes centuries. Here, we describe the diversity of collections data archived in museums and provide an overview of the diverse uses and applications of these data as discussed in the accompanying collection of papers within this theme issue. As these unparalleled resources are under threat owing to budget cuts and other institutional pressures, we aim to shed light on the unique discoveries that are possible in museums and, thus, the singular value of natural history collections in a period of rapid change.This article is part of the theme issue ‘Biological collections for understanding biodiversity in the Anthropocene’.},

To harness these properties, functional descriptions and design principles from all sources of biodiversity information must be collated − including the hundreds of thousands of possible survival features manifest in natural history museum collections, which represent 12\% of total global biodiversity. This requires a consortium of expert biologists from a range of disciplines to convert the observations, data, and hypotheses into the language of engineering. We hope to unite multidisciplinary biologists and natural history museum scientists to maximize the coverage of observations, descriptions, and hypotheses relating to adaptation and function across biodiversity, to make it technologically useful. This is to be achieved by developments in meta- taxonomic classification, phylogenetics, systematics, biological materials research, structure and morphological characterizations, and ecological data gathering from the collections − the aim being to identify and catalogue features essential for good biomimetic design.},

	abstract = {Background Genomic research depends upon access to DNA or tissue collected and preserved according to high-quality standards. At present, the collections in most natural history museums do not sufficiently address these standards, making them often hard or impossible to use for whole-genome sequencing or transcriptomics. In response to these challenges, natural history museums, herbaria, botanical gardens and other stakeholders have started to build high-quality biodiversity biobanks. Unfortunately, information about these collections remains fragmented, scattered and largely inaccessible. Without a central registry or even an overview of relevant institutions, it is difficult and time-consuming to locate the needed samples.Scope The Global Genome Biodiversity Network (GGBN) was created to fill this vacuum by establishing a one-stop access point for locating samples meeting quality standards for genome-scale applications, while complying with national and international legislations and conventions. Increased accessibility to genomic samples will further genomic research and development, conserve genetic resources, help train the next generation of genome researchers and raise the visibility of biodiversity collections. Additionally, the availability of a data-sharing platform will facilitate identification of gaps in the collections, thereby empowering targeted sampling efforts, increasing the breadth and depth of preservation of genetic diversity. The GGBN is rapidly growing and currently has 41 members. The GGBN covers all branches of the Tree of Life, except humans, but here the focus is on a pilot project with emphasis on ‘harvesting’ the Tree of Life for vascular plant taxa to enable genome-level studies.Conclusion While current efforts are centred on getting the existing samples of all GGBN members online, a pilot project, GGI-Gardens, has been launched as proof of concept. Over the next 6 years GGI-Gardens aims to add to the GGBN high-quality genetic material from at least one species from each of the approx. 460 vascular plant families and one species from half of the approx. 15 000 vascular plant genera.},

	abstract = {Collecting biological specimens for scientific studies came under scrutiny when B. A. Minteer et al. [“Avoiding (re)extinction,” Perspectives, 18 April, p. [260][1]] suggested that this practice plays a significant role in species extinctions. Based on a small number of examples (rare birds, frogs, and a few plants), the authors concluded that collection of voucher specimens is potentially harmful to many species, and that alternatives—photographs, audio recordings and nonlethal tissue sampling for DNA analysis—are sufficient to document biological diversity.

The isolated examples that Minteer et al. cited to demonstrate the negative impact of scientific collecting have been carefully analyzed, and none of these extinction events can be attributed to that cause ([ 1 ][3]–[ 3 ][4]). For example, only about 102 Great Auk specimens ( Pinguinus impennis ) exist today in scientific collections, many of which are skeletons obtained after extinction, whereas millions were harvested for food, oil, and feathers over millennia ([ 1 ][3]). Similarly, only nine Mexican elf owls ( Micrathene whitneyi graysoni ), endemic to Socorro Island, Mexico, are present in natural history collections. Field notes indicate that this species was common when specimens were collected between 1896 and 1932, and the most likely reasons for extinction around 1970 were habitat degradation and predation by invasive species ([ 2 ][5]).

Scientists have come a long way from the days of indiscriminate collecting. Modern collecting adheres to strict permitting regulations and ethics guidelines, including the general practice of collecting a number of specimens substantially below levels that would affect population demography ([ 3 ][4], [ 4 ][6]). The suggested alternatives to collecting specimens (photographing, recording calls, or sampling tissue nonlethally) are individually problematic, and even together cannot be used to reliably identify or describe the vast majority of Earth's biodiversity [for example, a large proportion of the world's marine biodiversity is hidden deep in its habitat (see image)]. Moreover, identification is often not the most important reason to collect voucher specimens. Studies of morphological diversity and its evolution are impossible without whole specimens. Preserved specimens also provide verifiable data points for monitoring species health, distribution, and phenotypes through time. Both historical and new collections played a key role in understanding the spread of the chytrid fungus infection, one of the greatest current threats to amphibians ([ 5 ][7]). The decision to ban dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and other environmental pollutants was the result of the discovery of thinning of bird eggshells collected over an extended period ([ 6 ][8]). One of the negative effects of climate change, declining body size in animals, was only discovered with morphological data from museum specimens ([ 7 ][9]). Furthermore, IUCN Red List criteria require specific and detailed information about life history and biology (such as longevity and growth rate), especially for widely distributed species; therefore, without specimens, the extinction risk of many species cannot be properly assessed ([ 8 ][10]). Most specimens were not collected with these objectives in mind, and this is a hallmark of biological collections: They are often used in ways that the original collector never imagined. With new technologies continuing to emerge (such as stable isotope analyses, massive parallel sequencing, and CT-scan tomography), scientific collections are becoming even more important for studies of ecology, evolution, and conservation ([ 9 ][11]).

The arguments of Minteer et al. erroneously portray the critical importance of scientific collecting in a negative light and distract from the primary causes of modern extinction: habitat degradation and loss, unsustainable harvesting, and invasive species ([ 10 ][12]). It is important to distinguish protecting the lives of individuals from conserving populations and species. Individuals are lost every day to predation, natural death, and anthropogenic factors, hence it is the populations we try to save. Halting collection of voucher specimens by scientists would be detrimental not only to our understanding of Earth's diverse biota and its biological processes, but also for conservation and management efforts. Species descriptions, biodiversity inventories, and the identification of areas of endemism are just some of the basic information that can be obtained from specimens and collections-based research. Such knowledge, with its rich temporal and spatial dimensions, has proven fundamental in designing conservation areas and in making environmental impact assessments ([ 11 ][13]). These issues are particularly relevant in many developing nations, which ideally must seek a balance between the conservation of their natural (biological) resources and development. One example comes from the Bird's Head Peninsula of New Guinea, Indonesia, where the discovery and description of small endemic species—undetectable without specimen collection—directly resulted in the creation of several new protected areas and increased support for marine parks ([ 12 ][14]).

With our ever-increasing footprint, humans now affect even the most remote corners of Earth. Because an estimated 86\% of species on the planet remain unknown ([ 13 ][15]), our goal should be to document biodiversity as rigorously as possible through carefully planned collections so that it can be effectively preserved and understood. Specimens from such collections and their associated data are essential for making informed decisions about management and conservation now and in the future. As a community, we advocate the utmost responsibility and care while making scientific collections ([ 4 ][6]). Furthermore, given increasing rates of habitat loss and global change, we believe that responsibly collecting voucher specimens and associated data and openly sharing this knowledge (for example, through GBIF, iDigBio, and VertNet) are more necessary today than ever before.

	abstract = {Urban environments are among the fastest changing habitats on the planet, and this change has evolutionary implications for the organisms inhabiting them. Herein, we demonstrate that natural history collections are critical resources for urban evolution studies. The specimens housed in these collections provide great potential for diverse types of urban evolution research, and strategic deposition of specimens and other materials from contemporary studies will determine the resources and research questions available to future urban evolutionary biologists. As natural history collections are windows into the past, they provide a crucial historical timescale for urban evolution research. While the importance of museum collections for research is generally appreciated, their utility in the study of urban evolution has not been explicitly evaluated. Here, we: (a) demonstrate that museum collections can greatly enhance urban evolution studies, (b) review patterns of specimen use and deposition in the urban evolution literature, (c) analyze how urban versus rural and native versus nonnative vertebrate species are being deposited in museum collections, and (d) make recommendations to researchers, museum professionals, scientific journal editors, funding agencies, permitting agencies, and professional societies to improve archiving policies. Our analyses of recent urban evolution studies reveal that museum specimens can be used for diverse research questions, but they are used infrequently. Further, although nearly all studies we analyzed generated resources that could be deposited in natural history collections (e.g., collected specimens), a minority (12\%) of studies actually did so. Depositing such resources in collections is crucial to allow the scientific community to verify, replicate, and/or re-visit prior research. Therefore, to ensure that adequate museum resources are available for future urban evolutionary biology research, the research community—from practicing biologists to funding agencies and professional societies—must make adjustments that prioritize the collection and deposition of urban specimens.},

	abstract = {Natural history collections have long been used by morphologists, anatomists, and taxonomists to probe the evolutionary process and describe biological diversity. These biological archives also offer great opportunities for genetic research in taxonomy, conservation, systematics, and population biology. They allow assays of past populations, including those of extinct species, giving context to present patterns of genetic variation and direct measures of evolutionary processes. Despite this potential, museum specimens are difficult to work with because natural postmortem processes and preservation methods fragment and damage DNA. These problems have restricted geneticists' ability to use natural history collections primarily by limiting how much of the genome can be surveyed. Recent advances in DNA sequencing technology, however, have radically changed this, making truly genomic studies from museum specimens possible. We review the opportunities and drawbacks of the use of museum specimens, and suggest how to best execute projects when incorporating such samples. Several high-throughput (HT) sequencing methodologies, including whole genome shotgun sequencing, sequence capture, and restriction digests (demonstrated here), can be used with archived biomaterials.},

Biological collections underpin basic science discoveries as well as deepen our understanding of many challenges such as global change, biodiversity loss, sustainable food production, ecosystem conservation, and improving human health and security. They are important resources for education, both in formal training for the science and technology workforce, and in informal learning through schools, citizen science programs, and adult learning. However, the sustainability of biological collections is under threat. Without enhanced strategic leadership and investments in their infrastructure and growth many biological collections could be lost.},

	abstract = {Museum specimens include genetic information from when they were collected. This historical information, which is very difficult to ascertain from samples collected currently, could be a valuable material for use in conservation genetics. However, the genetic analysis of museum specimens is technically difficult because of DNA fragmentation and the deamination of cytosine to uracil. In recent years, various methods have been developed for the genetic analysis of museum specimens, such as data analysis techniques including next-generation sequencing. The development of approaches that extract historical genetic information from museum specimens is expected to provide a new perspective on conservation genetics. This review focuses on the availability of museum specimens as genetic resources for conservation genetics. Some case studies are introduced, and perspectives on the future utility of conservation genetic studies using museum specimens are discussed. Moreover, recommended genetic analysis methods and important points for the usage of museum specimens are presented. This review provides a strong case for increasing the usage of museum specimens in conservation genetics studies in the future.},

	abstract = {Evolutionary convergence has been long considered primary evidence of adaptation driven by natural selection and provides opportunities to explore evolutionary repeatability and predictability. In recent years, there has been increased interest in exploring the genetic mechanisms underlying convergent evolution, in part, owing to the advent of genomic techniques. However, the current ‘genomics gold rush’ in studies of convergence has overshadowed the reality that most trait classifications are quite broadly defined, resulting in incomplete or potentially biased interpretations of results. Genomic studies of convergence would be greatly improved by integrating deep ‘vertical’, natural history knowledge with ‘horizontal’ knowledge focusing on the breadth of taxonomic diversity. Natural history collections have and continue to be best positioned for increasing our comprehensive understanding of phenotypic diversity, with modern practices of digitization and databasing of morphological traits providing exciting improvements in our ability to evaluate the degree of morphological convergence. Combining more detailed phenotypic data with the well-established field of genomics will enable scientists to make progress on an important goal in biology: to understand the degree to which genetic or molecular convergence is associated with phenotypic convergence. Although the fields of comparative biology or comparative genomics alone can separately reveal important insights into convergent evolution, here we suggest that the synergistic and complementary roles of natural history collection-derived phenomic data and comparative genomics methods can be particularly powerful in together elucidating the genomic basis of convergent evolution among higher taxa.This article is part of the theme issue ‘Convergent evolution in the genomics era: new insights and directions’.},

	abstract = {Natural history museums are unique spaces for interdisciplinary research and educational innovation. Through extensive exhibits and public programming and by hosting rich communities of amateurs, students, and researchers at all stages of their careers, they can provide a place-based window to focus on integration of science and discovery, as well as a locus for community engagement. At the same time, like a synthesis radio telescope, when joined together through emerging digital resources, the global community of museums (the ‘Global Museum’) is more than the sum of its parts, allowing insights and answers to diverse biological, environmental, and societal questions at the global scale, across eons of time, and spanning vast diversity across the Tree of Life. We argue that, whereas natural history collections and museums began with a focus on describing the diversity and peculiarities of species on Earth, they are now increasingly leveraged in new ways that significantly expand their impact and relevance. These new directions include the possibility to ask new, often interdisciplinary questions in basic and applied science, such as in biomimetic design, and by contributing to solutions to climate change, global health and food security challenges. As institutions, they have long been incubators for cutting-edge research in biology while simultaneously providing core infrastructure for research on present and future societal needs. Here we explore how the intersection between pressing issues in environmental and human health and rapid technological innovation have reinforced the relevance of museum collections. We do this by providing examples as food for thought for both the broader academic community and museum scientists on the evolving role of museums. We also identify challenges to the realization of the full potential of natural history collections and the Global Museum to science and society and discuss the critical need to grow these collections. We then focus on mapping and modelling of museum data (including place-based approaches and discovery), and explore the main projects, platforms and databases enabling this growth. Finally, we aim to improve relevant protocols for the long-term storage of specimens and tissues, ensuring proper connection with tomorrow’s technologies and hence further increasing the relevance of natural history museums.},

	abstract = {Natural history museums attract millions of visitors every year worldwide. Their collections, often inherited from centuries past, were gathered for scientific as well as educational purposes – and in many cases are still used for just that. However, since at least the 1950s, natural history collections have been perceived as a burden on museums and academic institutions, of little use other than exhibition in dusty cabinets, occupying space that could be used for more spectacular means of attracting the public. Yet natural history collections, even older collections, do have other uses, many of which have far-reaching consequences in terms of societal well-being, inclusion, and participation, which are often unrecognized in the collective mind of public and stakeholders alike. The aim of this paper is to review the available literature and discuss concrete examples where the use of natural history collections has resulted in benefits for society as a whole or within a single community. Natural history collections are repositories of reference material, allow earlier findings to be reproduced, and new technology constantly reveals new information no one suspected they could carry. New contributions of natural history collections are now more important to society than the original reason for going out and collecting specimens. They provide evidence of long-term historical trends, allowing researchers to make predictions into the future.},

Global biological diversity and changes in that diversity are directly tracked through specimens in collections, regardless of whether changes are ancient or recent. We discuss how collections, specimens, and the data associated with them, can be critical components linking nature and scientific inquiry. Specimens are the basic tools for educating students and interested citizens through direct or virtual contact with the diversity of collections. Such interactions include instruction in a formal classroom setting, volunteering to gather and curate collections, and informal presentations at coffee shops. We emphasize how the recent surge in specimen-based digitization initiatives has resulted in unprecedented access to a wealth of biodiversity information and how this availability vastly expands the reach of natural history collections. The emergence of online databases enables scientists and the public to utilize the specimens and associated data contained in natural history collections to address global, regional, and local issues related to biodiversity in a way that was unachievable a decade ago.},

	abstract = {The accessibility of global biodiversity information has surged in the past two decades, notably through widespread funding initiatives for museum specimen digitization and emergence of large-scale public participation in community science. Effective use of these data requires the integration of disconnected datasets, but the scientific impacts of consolidated biodiversity data networks have not yet been quantified. To determine whether data integration enables novel research, we carried out a quantitative text analysis and bibliographic synthesis of {\textgreater}4,000 studies published from 2003 to 2019 that use data mediated by the world’s largest biodiversity data network, the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). Data available through GBIF increased 12-fold since 2007, a trend matched by global data use with roughly two publications using GBIF-mediated data per day in 2019. Data-use patterns were diverse by authorship, geographic extent, taxonomic group, and dataset type. Despite facilitating global authorship, legacies of colonial science remain. Studies involving species distribution modeling were most prevalent (31\% of literature surveyed) but recently shifted in focus from theory to application. Topic prevalence was stable across the 17-y period for some research areas (e.g., macroecology), yet other topics proportionately declined (e.g., taxonomy) or increased (e.g., species interactions, disease). Although centered on biological subfields, GBIF-enabled research extends surprisingly across all major scientific disciplines. Biodiversity data mobilization through global data aggregation has enabled basic and applied research use at temporal, spatial, and taxonomic scales otherwise not possible, launching biodiversity sciences into a new era.},

Widespread perception persists that the removal of individuals from wild populations will affect the integrity of natural communities. Ecological studies often document the resilience of wildlife to sustainable removal and the negligible contributions to mortality of scientific collecting compared with those of other natural or anthropogenic-induced causes. Nevertheless, few studies have directly assessed the consequences of specimen removal on populations or communities. We present long-term ecological research data that suggest removal trapping has negligible impacts on the species richness, diversity, or abundance of small mammals. The maintenance and future growth of natural-history archives for integrated biodiversity sciences may hinge on increased dedication to specimen vouchering across ecological and evolutionary disciplines and wider acceptance by regulatory authorities and funding agencies.

The answers to these questions are often not only elusive but complex. We believe that an array of helpful investigative tools have been overlooked. The answers to these and other critical questions may be available “off the shelf”: the shelves of scientific collections in research institutes and museums. Taking better advantage of such collections could offer public health agencies at all levels—local, state, national, and international—a much larger toolkit for characterizing, mitigating, and predicting emerging infectious diseases. In doing so, scientific collections could find new users, new impact, and new sources of support. Public health first-responders and scientific collections might not seem like obvious allies, but they can benefit from deeper collaboration. We suggest that researchers, public health officials, and others should …

	abstract = {The technological ability to characterize genetic variation at a genome-wide scale provides an unprecedented opportunity to study the genetic underpinnings and evolutionary mechanisms that promote and sustain biodiversity. The transition from short- to long-read sequencing is particularly promising and allows a more holistic view on any changes in genetic diversity across time and space. Long-read sequencing has tremendous potential but sequencing success strongly depends on the long-range integrity of DNA molecules and therefore on the availability of high-quality tissue samples. With the scope of genomic experiments expanding and wild populations simultaneously disappearing at an unprecedented rate, access to high-quality samples may soon be a major concern for many projects. The need for high-quality biodiversity tissue archives is therefore urgent but sampling and preserving high-quality samples is not a trivial exercise. In this review, I will briefly outline how long-read sequencing can benefit the study of molecular ecology, how this will substantially increase the demand for high-quality tissues and why it is challenging to preserve DNA integrity. I will then provide an overview of preservation approaches and end with a call for support to acknowledge the efforts needed to assemble high-quality tissue archives. In doing so, I hope to simultaneously motivate field biologists to expand sampling practices and molecular biologists to develop (cost) efficient guidelines for the sampling and long-term storage of tissues. A concerted, interdisciplinary, effort is needed to catalogue the genetic variation underlying contemporary biodiversity and will eventually provide a critical resource for future studies.},

	abstract = {A long-standing question in biology is how organisms change through time and space in response to their environment. This knowledge is of particular relevance to predicting how organisms might respond to future environmental changes caused by human-induced global change. Usually researchers make inferences about past events based on an understanding of current static genetic patterns, but these are limited in their capacity to inform on underlying past processes. Natural history collections (NHCs) represent a unique and critical source of information to provide temporally deep and spatially broad time-series of samples. By using NHC samples, researchers can directly observe genetic changes over time and space and link those changes with specific ecological/evolutionary events. Until recently, such genetic studies were hindered by the intrinsic challenges of NHC samples (i.e. low yield of highly fragmented DNA). However, recent methodological and technological developments have revolutionized the possibilities in the novel field of NHC genomics. In this Special Feature, we compile a range of studies spanning from methodological aspects to particular case studies which demonstrate the enormous potential of NHC samples for accessing large genomic data sets from the past to advance our knowledge on how populations and species respond to global change at multiple spatial–temporal scales. We also highlight possible limitations, recommendations and a few opportunities for future researchers aiming to study NHC genomics.},
